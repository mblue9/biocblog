<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conference-infrastructure-and-tools">Conference Infrastructure and Tools</h2>
<p>Ensuring a smooth and accessible experience for all attendees, both in-person and virtual, was a top priority for BioC2024. Here’s how we made that happen:</p>
<p><strong>RingCentral Platform</strong></p>
<p>The BioC2024 conference utilized the <a href="https://www.ringcentral.com/">RingCentral</a> platform to stream talks and sessions to virtual attendees. This setup allowed participants from around the globe to access the live content in real-time, regardless of their location. Recordings of each day’s sessions were made available from 9 PM, giving attendees the flexibility to catch up on any talks they missed. These recordings will remain accessible for a month after the conference, after which they will be added to the Bioconductor YouTube channel for long-term access. However, we also received some feedback about minor issues with the platform. A few attendees noted that the video resolution could be improved, with occasional blurriness affecting the clarity of slides and content. We’re taking this feedback on board as we plan for future events, ensuring we continue to enhance the virtual experience for all participants.</p>
<p><strong>Workshop Infrastructure</strong></p>
<p>One of the key components of BioC2024 was the hands-on workshops. To ensure these sessions ran smoothly, we leveraged the Bioconductor Galaxy cloud platform, skillfully set up by Alex Mahmoud from the Bioconductor Core Team. This platform allowed participants to interactively run workshops from anywhere, making it easier for both in-person and virtual attendees to follow along.</p>
<p>Alex also created a quick <a href="https://video.recordonce.com/share/aGLVhlIjQhl">2-minute video tutorial</a> on how to use the platform, making sure everyone could jump in without a hitch. If you missed the live workshops, don’t worry—they’ll be available under the “Archived” section at workshop.bioconductor.org, alongside workshops from previous BioC, EuroBioC, and BioC Asia events.</p>
<p><a href="images/workshops.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-8"><img src="https://bioconductor.github.io/biocblog/posts/2024-08-12-bioc2024-recap/images/workshops.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:70.0%"></a></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><em>Workshops by the numbers</em></p>
</div>
<p><strong>BioC2024 Slack</strong></p>
<p>To enhance communication and connection among attendees, we introduced a dedicated BioC2024 Slack workspace. This platform became a hub for real-time interaction, with channels tailored to different aspects of the conference, such as:</p>
<p>#general: Conference-wide announcements and discussions.<br>
#travel-buddies: Coordination of travel plans, like sharing rides from the airport. #local-tips: Recommendations for places to eat, visit, or explore in Grand Rapids. #introductions: A space for attendees to introduce themselves and get to know each other. #help-desk: For any questions or assistance needed during the conference. #feedback: To gather suggestions and impressions in real-time.</p>
<p>The Slack space was well-received, with 798 messages exchanged, showing how much attendees valued this mode of communication.</p>
<p>The feedback from virtual attendees highlighted appreciation for the infrastructure. As one participant shared, <em>“This was also the best virtual conference experience I have had. I found the platform easy to use, enjoyed being able to use Galaxy to see some of the code myself, and I really liked the setup.”</em> Another attendee appreciated the inclusivity of the virtual setup, stating, <em>“Despite the distance and time difference, I was still able to be a part of the conference. I learned a little more about the Bioconductor community also.”</em></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-did-attendees-like">What did attendees like?</h2>
<p>BioC2024 received positive feedback from attendees, many of whom appreciated the opportunity to deepen their connection to the Bioconductor community. One such reflection came from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bioconductor_bioc2024-activity-7217905914966667264-i79r">Boyi Guo</a>, a Postdoctoral Fellow in Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University and one of the conference presenters. During one of the evening social events, Boyi shared how attending BioC2024 transformed his understanding of the community. He later provided this testimonial:</p>
<p><em>“After years of being both a user and developer of Bioconductor, I finally attended my first BioC conference this past summer—and it was an incredible experience! Despite being a newcomer to the BioC conference, BioC2024 felt like a true homecoming.</em></p>
<p><em>There was something really special about the conference—it was inclusive and lively. You could really feel the energy in the thoughtful and friendly scientific discussions, the meaningful conversations during breaks, and the laughter at the social events.</em></p>
<p><em>What excited me most was finally meeting the people behind the familiar names on mailing lists and GitHub—the ones who had answered my questions, reviewed my packages, and built the tools that are essential to my work. Before attending, ‘community’ was just a word to me. But seeing how friendly and welcoming everyone was, and witnessing the recognition by the community of its members during the awards ceremony, really showed me what makes this community special.</em></p>
<p><em>I’m really grateful to be part of a community with such a rich history. It’s all about simple but powerful goals—like working together to create and share innovative software, making it easier for people to get into interdisciplinary research, and ensuring research results can be reproduced anywhere.</em></p>
<p><em>BioC wasn’t just another conference; it felt like a celebration of a thriving community that truly inspires and empowers you.”</em></p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><em>Translated versions of this post are available in <a href="../../posts-nolist/2024-07-29-athena-award/index-es.html">Spanish</a> and <a href="../../posts-nolist/2024-07-29-athena-award/index-ca.html">Catalan</a>.</em></p>
<p>Beatriz Calvo-Serra (Barcelona, Feb.&nbsp;2nd, 1996 - Jan.&nbsp;10th, 2024) was a PhD student who was passionate about computational biology and an active and valued contributor to Bioconductor. We celebrate Bea (pronounced beh-ah)’s achievements and are inspired by her determination, as she overcame many obstacles to pursue her passion for science. She lived and worked with the aid of a powered wheelchair due to a congenital myopathy caused by a rare recessive mutation in the Ryanodine Receptor 1 (RYR1) gene. Bea sadly passed away on January 10th, 2024. We mourn her loss to our community and offer our condolences to her family, friends, and colleagues.</p>
<p>Bea’s journey was marked by significant achievements. Her potential for academic excellence was evident early in her education. In 2014, she graduated with honors from high school, and between 2014 and 2018, she pursued a degree in Human Biology at the <a href="https://www.upf.edu">Pompeu Fabra University (UPF)</a> in Barcelona, Spain. This was a significant challenge for both her and the university, as she was the first student with more than 90% physical disability at the UPF campus of life sciences. However, Bea faced this challenge with enthusiasm and patience, working closely with the <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/upfinclusio">UPF Inclusion office</a> to make the campus accessible. Her efforts have left a lasting legacy, with adapted lecture rooms, computer rooms, toilets, and other facilities now benefiting future students.</p>
<p>During the last year of her undergraduate degree, Bea discovered her passion for bioinformatics and computational biology. In the next academic year, 2018-19, she completed a Master’s Programme in Omics Data Analysis at <a href="https://www.uvic.cat">Vic University</a>.</p>
<p>Shortly after, in 2019-20, she joined the PhD Programme in Biomedicine at the Department of Medicine and Life Sciences (MELIS) at the UPF, working in the functional genomics group under the supervision of Robert Castelo. The MELIS department is located at the <a href="https://prbb.org">Barcelona Biomedical Research Park (PRBB)</a>, which is home to about 1,400 people from seven public research institutions. During her PhD, Bea’s kindness and generosity to help others were evident. She was an active member of the diversity and inclusion committee at the PRBB, advising on how to adapt the spaces in the building for people with physical disabilities.</p>
<p>In the few years she worked towards her PhD, Bea was an active contributor to the Bioconductor project, developing the software packages <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/atena">atena</a> and <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/gDNAx">gDNAx</a>. Her kindness, strength, and endurance will always be remembered. She answered questions about her packages on the Bioconductor support site, and participated online in the 2021 and 2022 editions of the North American and European Bioconductor conferences, respectively.</p>
<p>Bea helped us understand that members of our community may have logistical challenges with transportation and in-person attendance. Virtual access enabled her to participate and present her work at the BioC 2021 virtual conference, and at EuroBioC 2022 in Heidelberg. We will ensure continued virtual access to our conferences, where possible, as it makes participation and contribution to Bioconductor more inclusive.</p>
<p>In recognition of her outstanding contributions and the inspiration her legacy provides to the community, we are honored to create this award, the Athena Award, and posthumously award the inaugural Bioconductor Athena Award to Bea. This award celebrates her strength and resilience in overcoming challenges and her community spirit. Her kindness and generosity, her commitment to improving inclusion, especially for those with disabilities, and most of all, her passion to contribute to Bioconductor. Bea’s legacy affirms the core values of Bioconductor.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/about/code-of-conduct/">Bioconductor community values</a> an open approach to science that promotes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Science: sharing of ideas, code, software and expertise.</li>
<li>Collaboration: Encouraging teamwork and cooperation.</li>
<li>Diversity and inclusivity Supporting participation of all.</li>
<li>Welcoming environment: creating a kind environment.</li>
<li>Community contributions: valuing input of all members.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bea’s Bioconductor package <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/atena">atena</a> was aptly named. We name this award in her honor. Athena was the Greek goddess of wisdom, known for her courage in the face of adversity. With intellect to navigate challenges and unyielding courage Athena is the symbol of empowerment and inspiration. The Bioconductor Athena Award will celebrate our community members, who overcome challenges to participate and contribute to Bioconductor.</p>
<p>We are grateful to Robert Castelo, Bea’s PhD supervisor, and Bea’s family and friends. This posthumous award will be presented in person to her family at EuroBioc 2024 in Oxford in September.</p>

<ul>
<li>Announce each others’ events on websites or social media</li>
<li>Jointly host events</li>
<li>Promote R-Ladies local watch parties of live-casted or pre-recorded events and professional networking events for Bioconductor conferences (BioC: BioC North America, BioCAsia, EuroBioC) Highlight Bioconductor speakers at R + computational biology R-Ladies events across chapters</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Get Involved</strong></p>
<p>Excited to join us in this partnership? Here’s how you can get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn more about our joint efforts at the <a href="https://workinggroups.bioconductor.org/currently-active-working-groups-committees.html#r-ladies-and-bioc">Bioconductor Working Group page</a>.</li>
<li>Join our #rladies channel in <a href="https://slack.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor Slack</a> to stay updated and connect with the community.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're kicking off this journey with local networking in R-Ladies chapters worldwide (e.g., <a href="https://www.meetup.com/rladies-aurora/events/302185687/">Aurora, Colorado</a>) and an R-Ladies meetup in Michigan during BioC 2024, co-hosted with <a href="https://www.meetup.com/rladies-east-lansing/events/302185529/">R-Ladies East Lansing</a> (Michigan)!</p>
<p>We’re looking forward to building something great together. Let us know what you think, share your ideas, or just say hi!</p>

<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Open source is more than just a buzzword, it plays a crucial role in the tech ecosystem, fostering growth, collaboration, effective communication, and innovation. Participating in open source projects provides real-world experience, allowing contributors to make impactful contributions, learn best practices, and receive valuable feedback.</p>
<p>Outreachy offers internship opportunities in open source and open science, specifically for individuals underrepresented in the technological industry.</p>
<p>Through Outreachy, we were able to work as interns at Bioconductor, where we are currently contributing to the Microbiome Study Curation project. Whether you’re a first time contributor, an Outreachy applicant, or you are interested in contributing to the Bioconductor project, this blog post will provide detailed explanations and insights to guide you on how to make meaningful contributions.</p>
</section>
<section id="outreachy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="outreachy">Outreachy</h2>
<p>Outreachy is a paid remote internship program that aims to support underrepresented groups who face systemic bias or discrimination in the technology industry of their country. Outreachy interns work remotely with mentors from Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) communities on several projects including programming, user experience, documentation, illustration and graphical design, or data science. Read more about Outreachy <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/#what-is-outreachy">here</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>The application process for Outreachy consists of three steps:</p>
<section id="initial-application-period" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="initial-application-period">1. Initial application period:</h4>
<p>After making sure that you’re <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/apply/eligibility/">eligible to apply</a> for Outreachy, applicants proceed to fill out the initial application form, which consists of some Yes/ No answers and about four essays in which you share your personal stories of being underrepresented. After Outreachy organizers review the initial applications and essays, accepted applicants are notified via email. Read more about the application period <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/#application-period">here</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="contribution-period" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="contribution-period">2. Contribution period:</h4>
<p>The contribution period will open as soon as the initial application is accepted. ‘Open source contributors’ is the term used to describe those who regularly work on open source projects. When you contribute to an Outreachy project, you become an open source contributor. To have a successful contribution phase, the first step is to <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/apply/project-selection/">choose one or two projects</a> that pique your interest. Secondly, you must <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/#find-mentor">get in touch with the project mentor</a> for further information on how to start contributing. Lastly, start contributing and record your contributions. Only applicants who contribute to a project, record their contributions, and submit a final application on the Outreachy website are considered for internship.</p>
</section>
<section id="intern-selection-period" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="intern-selection-period">3. Intern selection period:</h4>
<p>After the final applications are evaluated, selected interns are announced shortly after. Applicants are advised to read the <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/docs/internship/">internship guide</a> to learn more about time commitment and more details about what Outreachy expects from interns.</p>

<section id="microbiome-study-curation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="microbiome-study-curation">Microbiome Study Curation</h2>
<p>The Microbiome Study Curation project is a Bioconductor project that uses <a href="https://bugsigdb.org/Main_Page">BugSigDB</a>, a database of manually curated microbial signatures obtained from the results of published microbiome differential abundance studies. Differential abundance studies are studies that compare the relative abundance of different microbial species in different samples in hosts of interest (humans, animals, and environmental conditions). In humans, they help to understand how different geographical and environmental factors can lead to changes in the microbiome, thereby increasing the likelihood of developing conditions such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular and neurological diseases, allergies, and inflammatory bowel disease. This information helps to give insights into the role of specific microbes in different biological processes or diseases. The Microbiome Study Curation project entails curating new studies on BugSigDB, reviewing studies that have already been curated, and analyzing BugSigDB data using R. To learn more about the project and how to contribute to it, check <a href="https://kunmiwrites.wordpress.com/2024/01/22/bugsigdb-101-a-beginners-guide-to-exploring-microbial-signatures/">Esther’s blog post</a>.</p>

<p>Hello there! I’m Esther Afuape, a graduate of microbiology from University of Lagos, Nigeria. I love reading crime/mystery fiction, cooking, and spending time at the beach.</p>
<p>I got to know about Outreachy through an acquaintance who was an intern in the program. I’m currently partaking in the December 2023 cohort and wrote about my experience during the contribution phase in my <a href="https://kunmiwrites.wordpress.com/2023/12/10/outreachy-week-1-introducing-me/">blog</a>. It’s been an awesome 8 whole weeks interning at Bioconductor! I wish I could slow down time because this means that the end of my internship is drawing closer. Before I applied for Outreachy and eventually came across Bioconductor on the Projects list, I was at a loss as to what to do with my microbiology degree in Nigeria, where a definitive niche for microbiologists is lacking. I had applied to the program with the hopes of doing a project in a different tech field. Coming across the Microbiome Curation Project was so exciting as it was related to my microbiology background. I found the project fascinating and immediately joined the project’s community Slack channel. What stood out for me was the support in the community. I found it easier to get a hang of things because there was always a mentor or other community members ready to help!</p>
<p>As an intern, I’ve worked on the project by carrying out reviews of curated studies. I’ve absolutely enjoyed doing this and I find it interesting to see how volatile the microbiome is and how subtle lifestyle choices can cause changes in it. My literature review skills have greatly improved and I have a better understanding of the scientific methods used in research. I also look forward to developing basic data analysis during the rest of my internship.</p>
<p>I’m so grateful for my mentor, Svetlana Perovic, for her invaluable guidance and support so far. Her mentorship has instilled in me the value of stepping out of my comfort zone. I’d also like to express my gratitude to other community members for always helping me out when I’m stuck, and the other mentors – Levi Waldron and Chloe Mirzayi, for entrusting me with this incredible opportunity. If you’d like to read more on my experience as a Bioconductor intern, I invite you to visit my blog <a href="https://kunmiwrites.wordpress.com/2023/12/10/outreachy-week-1-introducing-me/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Hi! My name is Peace Sandy, and I’m from Nigeria. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Microbiology and am both a Software Developer and a Technical Writer. Research is my passion, and I’m very interested in Bioinformatics. My hobbies are reading, coding, and baking.</p>
<p>During the Outreachy contribution period, I specifically sought projects that aligned with my skill set. Finding the Microbiome Study Curation project was thrilling, as it combined my research interests with microbiome studies.</p>
<p>My long standing fascination with Bioinformatics, microbiome studies, open science, and research made the Microbiome Study Curation project highly appealing. Participating as an Outreachy intern in Bioconductor has been an incredibly educational and rewarding experience. I’ve had the privilege of learning from experienced mentors and open-source contributors. The Bioconductor community is extremely welcoming and collaborative.</p>
<p>I am confident that the exposure and knowledge I am gaining from the Bioconductor community will significantly contribute to my career advancement. Having interned for over a month, the experience has been truly amazing. My mentor, Levi Waldron, has been incredibly supportive, patient, and welcoming, as have the other mentors, Chloe Mirzayi and Svetlana Perovic.</p>
<p>So far, I’ve learned a tremendous amount, and my knowledge of microbiome studies, R programming, and research skills has significantly improved. I now have a better understanding of ontology terms.</p>

<p>Everyday of the past few months with Outreachy has been an opportunity to learn something new, I consider myself lucky to be part of the selected interns.</p>
<p>Hello, I’m Chioma Onyido, I’ve a BSc. and MSc. in Biochemistry/ Molecular Biology from Covenant University, Nigeria.</p>
<p>I had my first encounter with Bioinformatics in my undergraduate third year (2015) and have been interested in it since then. Driven by my love for data and combining the best of both worlds (biology and data science), in 2022, I took a bold step to transition. I started learning how to code, picking up Bioinformatics projects and practicing with them.</p>
<section id="here-is-why-i-chose-bioconductor" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="here-is-why-i-chose-bioconductor">Here is why I chose Bioconductor</h4>
<p>I learned about Outreachy from a buddy during one of our chats, so I decided to look into it further while doing my research. After my initial application was approved, I knew that I was going to apply for a Bioinformatics/ biology-related project, because I am really curious and passionate about exploring and becoming a voice in this field. I initially began contributing to three projects on the Outreachy website during the contribution phase, but I decided to stick with the Bioconductor Microbiome Study Curation project for many reasons:</p>
<p>Passion: “Microbiome knowledge” and “literature review” were listed as the required skills that resonated well with my professional strengths and passion.</p>
<p>Supportive community: I chose Bioconductor because of how interactive and supportive the community is. Before applying for Outreachy, I did well to read blogs by alums on the best way to go about applying for the internship, looking out more specifically for the do’s and dont’s, and one consistent advice I saw was- “applying for more than 1 project increases one’s chances”. I tried to do this, but it didn’t take me too long to realize that I’d rather focus my energy and time on one thing, put my best into it and DO IT VERY WELL.</p>
<p>It’s the ‘BugSigDB vibe’ for me: One thing that intrigued me about the BugSigDB project is the fact that we share similar values- I love to help and see people win, and I saw a similar energy in the BugSigDB community. Even with the influx of comments, observations and/or questions from contributors during the Outreachy contribution phase, the BugSigDB community was active, and so were the mentors. The mentors were (still are) attentive, patient, thorough and present.</p>
<p>Premium learning experience: In terms of my professional growth, BugSigDB has significantly contributed to this area by providing valuable courses for my continuous development. Thanks to the BugSigDB community- Professor Levi, I was given access to a paid DataCamp classroom, where I’ve had the opportunity to enhance my skills and boost my confidence in R programming.</p>
<p>I am grateful to my mentor Chloe Mirzayi for her time and efforts in my growth and progress. I am also grateful to Svetlana Perovic for her guidance, and for being there to cross my T’s and dot my I’s whenever I reach out. I consider it a privilege and a blessing to be in the best community, contributing to such a big project.</p>

  <title>Bioconductor is leaving Twitter/X</title>
  <dc:creator>Maria Doyle</dc:creator>
  <link>https://bioconductor.github.io/biocblog/posts/2023-11-17-twitter-exit/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Bioconductor is committed to nurturing an environment that reflects our values. To this end, we’ve decided to move our social media engagement away from Twitter/X. The platform’s current direction no longer aligns with our <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/about/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>’s key principle: <em>“Bioconductor is dedicated to providing a welcoming, supportive, collegial experience free of harassment, intimidation, and bullying”</em>.</p>
<p>This decision echoes your sentiments from our recent community survey on Twitter/X. We received 142 responses and many of you expressed concerns about the increasing hate speech and harassment you’ve witnessed. Although the platform has been important in our outreach, it’s clear that its direction is no longer compatible with the principles of Bioconductor. Henceforth, we’re focusing our efforts on our accounts in platforms that better resonate with our ethos, such as <a href="https://genomic.social/@bioconductor">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/bioconductor/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/bioconductor">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://slack.bioconductor.org/">Slack</a>, <a href="https://blog.bioconductor.org/">our blog</a>, <a href="https://support.bioconductor.org/">support site</a> and <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/bioc-devel">developer mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>We will stop using Twitter/X from <strong>December 17th 2023</strong>. Our account will remain inactive, serving as an archive rather than a conduit for communication. We encourage you to join us in these other spaces that support constructive and respectful dialogue. We will post more about how/where to follow us in the future.</p>
<p>For questions or feedback, please contact us through the Bioconductor Slack #social-media channel or the Community Manager maria.doyle@ul.ie.</p>

<p>Many emerging cutting-edge topics in computational biology and bioinformatics were discussed at BioC2023; including methods for analysis of spatial single cell, multi-modal data integration, microbiome resources, telomere to telomere (T2T) genome, long-read sequencing, splice variant calling and so much more! Community contributors gave twelve short talks selected from submitted abstracts on a wide range of ’omics topics, sixteen package demos took place along with six in-depth interactive workshops. The demos gave shorter thirty to forty-five minute package overviews whilst the workshops were more intense with them being ninety minutes each in duration. All workshop and demo materials are shared on <a href="https://bioc2023.bioconductor.org/workshops/">the conference website</a>.</p>

  <title>Testing Packages on Linux ARM64 with GitHub Actions</title>

</div>
<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The Bioconductor Build System (BBS) now includes routine package testing on Linux ARM64, but the relatively low frequency of testing means this, if a problem occurs with your package, it can take a while to identify and fix the issue using the build system alone.</p>
<p>The previous blog post “<a href="https://bioconductor.github.io/biocblog/posts/2023-06-09-debug-linux-arm64-on-docker/">Emulated build and test of Bioconductor packages for Linux ARM64</a>” described how one can use Docker and architecture emulation to build, test, and debug a Bioconductor package for running on Linux ARM64 architecture when you only have access to local x86 hardware.</p>
<p>However such manual testing can be frustrating to run as a package developer, either because it’s an extra task you have to run frequently, or because you only do it occasionally and forget the steps involved. Ideally such testing would happen automatically whenever you make changes to a package, but providing more rapid feedback than the BBS provides. In this article we build on these previously presented ideas to describe one approach for testing package on Linux ARM64 using a continuous integration environment on GitHub Actions.</p>
</section>
<section id="workflow-implementation" class="level1">
<h1>Workflow Implementation</h1>
<p>An example workflow implementation can be found at <a href="https://github.com/grimbough/bioc-testing-with-arm64/blob/main/.github/workflows/test-package-arm64.yml">https://github.com/grimbough/bioc-testing-with-arm64/blob/main/.github/workflows/test-package-arm64.yml</a>. In the remainder of this post we’ll discuss some of the implementation choices made there and how they work.</p>
<section id="choice-of-docker-container" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="choice-of-docker-container">Choice of Docker container</h2>
<p>The first thing to remember when using architecture emulation is that everything works much slower than when running natively - typically by at least an order of magnitude. This influences some of the decisions made during this workflow regarding which containers to use and what we want to cache between workflow steps. Some operations that might be acceptable in a standard workflow become painfully slow under emulation, and so we try reduce the number of slow steps.</p>
<p>The first of these is to use a modified version of the <a href="https://github.com/Bioconductor/bioconductor_docker/pkgs/container/bioconductor/102293490?tag=devel-amd64">Bioconductor:devel</a> docker image which has TinyTex pre-installed. This allows us to compile the package manual pages and and PDF vignettes during testing. Installing TinyTex and the required LaTeX packages takes approximately 10 minutes on our emulated system, so there is a noticeable time benefit to using an image with it already installed. The modified image can be found at <a href="https://ghcr.io/grimbough/bioc-with-tinytex:devel-arm64">ghcr.io/grimbough/bioc-with-tinytex:devel-arm64</a></p>
<p><em>Note: You could probably achieve a similar result by using the standard Bioconductor container and running <code>R CMD check</code> with the arguments <code>--no-manual</code> and <code>--no-build-vignettes</code>, however I would rather run the complete testing process in case there is problematic code in either the manual page examples or vignette.</em></p>
</section>
<section id="installing-packages" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="installing-packages">Installing packages</h2>
<p>Installing packages that require compilation is also incredibly slow on our emulated system, so it’s immediately desirable to cache the library of installed packages that are needed for testing. The <a href="https://github.com/actions/cache">actions/cache</a> GitHub action does a good job of this, however it will only create a cache after a successful job run. Given we’re creating this workflow to test a potentially problematic package, it can be frustrating to repeatedly wait several hours for all the necessary packages to install, because you haven’t managed to fix the issue.</p>
<p>Given this, we can split our workflow into two jobs; the first installs the packages while the second runs the actual package tests. With this structure a failure in the second job doesn’t prevent the cache mechanism from working and makes repeated runs much faster.</p>
<p>Now lets take a look at the first few steps on our <code>install-dependencies</code> job and explain what’s happening. Most of these steps are pretty standard for regular users of GitHub Actions.</p>

<p>Initially we create an empty directory on our runner. In this example this is in the runners temporary directory, but it could be anywhere. We’ll later mount this location into our Docker container, and it will contain the installed package library. We have to create it outside of the Docker container and mount it so that the caching mechanism will work. If this location was created inside the Docker container, it would disappear when the container was destroyed, and we wouldn’t be able to retain the contents.</p>
<p>We then provide this location to the <code>actions/cache</code> action, and use a hash of the <code>DESCRIPTION</code> file to tag our cache. Update the <code>DESCRIPTION</code> e.g.&nbsp;to add a new dependency or bump the version number and a new cache will be created. This isn’t perfect, as it won’t necessary capture updates to installed packages in the library, but it does a reasonable job with being too complex.</p>
<p>The final step of the job is to install the dependencies.</p>

<p>We use the <code>addnab/docker-run-action</code> action to run this step inside a docker container and provide the <code>image</code> argument with the TinyTex arm64 container discussed earlier.</p>
<p>The <code>options</code> argument supplies arguments you would give Docker at the command line if you were running it locally. Here we set the platform to <code>linux/arm64</code> to work with the QEMU emulation. We mount two locations from our runner into to container: the location of the library we created earlier and the directory containing the package to be tests. Inside the container these will be found at <code>/R-lib</code> and <code>/build</code> respectively. We also set the <code>R_LIBS_USER</code> environment variable, so R will use the mounted library in preference to anywhere else.</p>
<p>The <code>run</code> section is where we provide the command to be executed inside the container. First there’s an optional step to set the number of CPUs R should use by default. Currently GitHub runners are dual core and there’s a performance benefit to ensuring R uses both of these when installing multiple packages from source as we’re doing here. Then we use the <code>remotes</code> and <code>BiocManager</code> packages to list the package dependencies and install them.</p>
<p>If this job executes successfully we should have a cached library containing all the packages required to test the package.</p>
</section>
<section id="running-the-package-tests" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="running-the-package-tests">Running the package tests</h2>
<p>The second job in our workflow will carry out the package tests. We can use the <code>needs:</code> argument to specify that this job requires the <code>install-dependencies</code> job to have completed successfully. Without specifying this GitHub Actions will try to run the two jobs simultaneously, which clearly isn’t appropriate.</p>

<p>The first few steps are the same as before, checking out the package repository, installing QEMU, and then restoring the cached set of packages.</p>
<p>Next we can again use the <code>addnab/docker-run-action</code> action to execute our tests inside a docker container. We use the same container image and set of options as before to mount the package and library locations, as well as supplying the <code>--workdir</code> argument to ensure the following commands are executed in the folder where the package directory can be found.</p>

<p>We use the <code>run</code> option to provide steps similar to the Bioconductor Build System. There are four distinct stages to this process: install, build, check, and build binary. The arguments and setting used here are representative of the BBS, but one can change them if other testing mechanism are required. You could also choose to split this into four separate job steps if you wanted more fine grained control.</p>
<p>One minor wrinkle when running this in a Docker container is that GitHub Actions will use the return code of the Docker process to determine whether the step has failed or not, rather than the processes run inside the container. Thus it will often give a green tick, even if something went wrong, and it is easy to miss an error if just glancing at the step summaries. To resolve this, after each process in the container we test the return code produced by R and exit if it indicates failure.</p>
<p>Finally, although some of the test outputs will be printed to the workflow log, we might want to make any output available to download and investigate further. To do this we can use the <a href="https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact"><code>upload-artifact</code></a> action.</p>

<p>We use <code>if: always()</code> to ensure the upload happens even if a previous step has failed; it’s often more important to get the logs when there’s a problem! Assuming every step executed this should upload both the source and binary tarballs, the installation log file, and the folder produced by <code>R CMD check</code>. Hopefully that is enough information to diagnose any issue.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The combination of GitHub Actions and QEMU provides a platform for testing packages across multiple CPU architectures more rapidly than the Bioconductor Build System. Using them in a continuous integration environment allows one to detect and highlight unforeseen issues introduced by changes to a package or the wider R environment. The same emulation techniques can then be employed on your local development environment to find a solution, before testing again in a your GitHub Workflow, and finally deploying to Bioconductor.</p>

</div>
<p>I’m Sonali Kumari, a B.Tech student specializing in Electronics and Communication Engineering with a passion for Artificial Intelligence. Currently pursuing my studies at IGDTUW in Delhi, I find immense joy in working with open-source organizations that offer unique opportunities for learning, collaboration, and remarkable achievements, even in remote settings. With a diverse range of interests spanning technology and open science, I strive to merge technical expertise with a strong inclination towards research.</p>
<p>During the May 2023 internship round, I had the privilege of participating in the Outreachy Internship program with Bioconductor. This experience has been incredibly rewarding, as it has not only exposed me to the world of open science and open source but has also taught me how to collaborate effectively in a remote work environment. Despite the initial challenge of familiarizing myself with various concepts within a limited timeframe, my journey has been smoother than anticipated. I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to my mentor, Jen Wokaty, who has been an exceptional guide, always steering me in the right direction whenever I faced challenges. Their mentorship has taught me invaluable lessons in problem-solving, finding joy in my work, and so much more. I am immensely grateful for the knowledge and skills I have acquired under their guidance.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I want to share my enriching experience and the remarkable work I have been doing as part of the <a href="https://github.com/Bioconductor/sweave2rmd">Sweave2Rmd</a> project at Bioconductor. The sweave2rmd project focuses on converting vignettes from Sweave to R Markdown format, which plays a crucial role in modernizing the documentation of Bioconductor packages. Traditionally, the documentation has been written using a combination of LaTeX and R code, resulting in PDF files. By transforming these files into R Markdown format and rendering them as HTML files, we make the documentation more accessible, shareable, and interactive.</p>
<p>Throughout my internship, I have made significant contributions to the sweave2rmd project. Some of my accomplishments include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Converting numerous vignettes from Sweave to R Markdown format</li>
<li>Collaborating with maintainers to address issues and improve the conversion process</li>
<li>Taking the lead in maintaining the project board and tracking progress</li>
<li>Exploring automation processes to streamline the conversion workflow</li>
<li>Enhancing the project’s documentation for better usability and clarity</li>
</ul>
<p>These experiences have not only honed my technical skills but have also allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of package development and documentation creation within the vibrant Bioconductor community. I’m proud to have submitted a total of 12 pull requests (PRs), out of which 8 have been successfully merged into Bioconductor in just one month. I am thrilled to continue making a meaningful impact on the project.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in reading more about my experience as an Outreachy intern with Bioconductor and my journey with the sweave2rmd project, I invite you to visit my <a href="https://dev.to/sonali8434">blog</a>. I share insights, challenges, and lessons learned along the way.</p>
<p>I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Bioconductor, my mentors, and the entire community for providing me with this invaluable opportunity. Together, we are shaping the future of open science and making a difference in the world of scientific documentation.</p>

<section id="daenarys-experience-working-on-the-miaverse-project" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="daenarys-experience-working-on-the-miaverse-project">DaenaRys Experience: Working on the miaverse Project</h3>
<p>I am a final-year computer science student from Cameroon with a love for computers and technology. My fascination with biotechnology led me to choose the <a href="https://microbiome.github.io">miaverse</a> project under Bioconductor.</p>
<p>The miaverse is a microbiome analytics framework that combines both tools and documentation. The idea is to provide not only tools but also tutorials that help users with different skill levels to perform microbiome downstream analysis. The miaverse project focuses on optimizing unit tests in the miaverse packages, including mia, miaTime, miaViz, and miaSim, which are essential tools for analyzing microbiome data. In addition to optimization of unit tests and examples, current task include, improving documentation in packages, creating an example microbiome data science workflow from database to results, optimization of certain methods and testing, issue reporting, bug fixing.</p>
<p>I chose this project because of my passion for biotechnology and my fascination with the intricate interactions that occur within a microbiome. However, as I delved deeper into the project, I realized that analyzing microbiome data can be quite challenging due to the vast amounts of complex data involved. Therefore, I became determined to optimize the miaverse packages to make microbiome data analysis more efficient and accurate.</p>
<p>Working on the miaverse project has been an unforgettable experience for me. Throughout the project, I have had the pleasure of working closely with my mentor, Tuomas Borman. Tuomas’ expertise in the field has helped me understand the complexities involved in microbiome data analysis, and he has provided valuable feedback on my work.</p>
<p>The project itself has been challenging but rewarding, as it has allowed me to develop important skills such as problem-solving, teamwork, and communication. Through the optimization process and documentation unification, I have learned how to create user-friendly tools that can be used by a broad audience.</p>
<p>I am proud of the work I have accomplished so far and grateful for the opportunity to develop important skills during this internship with the aim of using technology to facilitate biotech data processes and analysis.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-i-came-to-know-about-open-source-and-the-outreachy-internships">How I came to know about Open Source and the Outreachy Internships</h4>
<p>When I was just starting out as a sophomore, while exploring about the many ways people can make a difference in computer science, I came across the many ways in which beginners could contribute to projects that made a difference, however small it was. I was fascinated by the world of open-source software and the way it operates. What drew me to this community was its collaborative nature. The idea that people from all over the world could come together to contribute their expertise and collectively create something truly remarkable was truly wonderful!</p>
<p>While surfing the web, I came across what seemed to me a brilliant opportunity to learn and contribute: the Outreachy internship. What drew me to it was the nature of the internship: we had to contribute to projects of our own choice for a month, and that meant that whether or not I got the internship, I would definitely get a chance to learn and interact with the open-source community! Once my initial application period was over, I took a few days to go over the many projects listed on the platform, for which we could choose to contribute.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-microbiome-study-curation-project-at-bioconductor" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-microbiome-study-curation-project-at-bioconductor">The Microbiome Study Curation Project at Bioconductor</h4>
<p>A lot of the projects were very appealing but what stood out to me was the ‘Microbiome Study curation’ project at <a href="https://bugsigdb.org/">BugSigDb</a>; for me, it was quite different to the others and while it wasn’t extremely tedious, it was fascinating to learn about the project: I realized how I wasn’t even properly aware of how epidemiological studies and research on samples of varying sizes and nature are critical for medical research, how they play a crucial role in medical research by providing insights into the distribution, causes, and prevention of diseases within populations. These studies involve the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data from large populations over time, and can help to identify risk factors, patterns of disease occurrence, and potential interventions that can improve public health.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/#make-contributions">Outreachy contribution period</a> was one of the best experiences I have ever had as a student. I genuinely loved making contributions and learning. My mentors, Chloe and Fatima as well as the BugSigdb community- Professor Levi and others always helped me out whenever I got stuck on a problem or had an issue in understanding something.</p>
</section>
<section id="about-the-project" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about-the-project">About the Project</h4>
<p>The Microbiome Study curation project mainly deals with reviewing existing epidemiological studies on BugSigdb and curating new studies on BugSigdb.</p>
<p>Throughout my internship, the contributions I have made include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reviewing existing curations of epidemiological studies on Bugsigdb</li>
<li>Finding and curating more epidemiological studies</li>
<li>Learning about the data analysis process using R and implementing it</li>
</ul>
<p>It has been a great source of knowledge for me, and has broadened my views as well as technical skills for understanding scientific articles, conducting a literature review and carrying out data analysis. The wonderful community at Bioconductor has only always helped me out and has provided me with a richer understanding of everything I’ve been doing! I’m really glad to be a part of this project. If you want to know more, I would love to introduce to you my <a href="https://atrayees0.wordpress.com/">blog</a>, where I record my progress as well as my experiences and learnings.</p>

<p>Bioconductor participated in the <a href="https://elixir-europe.org/events/elixir-all-hands-2023">ninth ELIXIR All Hands international event</a> which took place in the Dublin Convention centre from 5-8 June 2023. This was its first time ever being hosted in Ireland.</p>
<p><a href="https://elixir-europe.org/">ELIXIR</a> is an organisation that works to create EU infrastructure to make it easier for scientists to find, aggregate, analyse and store life-science data, This is achieved through open-source bioinformatics software which provides methods and tools to analyse life science data. One purpose of this event was to share the first results from a 40 million euro <a href="https://gdi.onemilliongenomes.eu/">Genomic Data Infrastructure project</a>. This project, which is coordinated by ELIXIR, is creating the infrastructure to allow secure access to Europe’s genome data with the goal of accelerating research of new treatments and therapies for disease, improving healthcare across Europe and beyond.</p>
<p>Bioconductor gave a workshop at this conference on the ‘Opportunities for Bioconductor and ELIXIR communities to co-develop training infrastructures’. This workshop was introduced by Bioconductor Community Manager, Dr.&nbsp;Maria Doyle, from the University of Limerick, Ireland. Following its introduction, Professor of Cancer Genomics, Aedin Culhane from University of Limerick gave an overview of Bioconductor’s work. Professor of Bioinformatics, Laurent Gatto, from UCLouvain, Belgium and Professor in Data Science, Leo Lahti, from the University of Turku, Finland followed Professor Culhane by speaking about Bioconductor’s training landscape. Dr.&nbsp;Doyle then gave a demo of Bioconductor’s Galaxy training infrastructure and also gave a talk on the future plans/ideas for Bioconductor/ELIXIR collaborations in training.</p>
<p>Professor Culhane who is director of the Limerick Digital Cancer Centre and sits on the leadership board of Bioconductor emphasized the benefits of connecting the global Bioconductor and ELIXIR bioinformatics communities. She said <em>“The Bioconductor and ELIXIR active communities are continuously working on improving and expanding functionally. By working together we can better develop, support and disseminate free open source software to the global bioinformatics community and thereby accelerate medical and biological research in treatments for patients with disease and cancer”</em>.</p>
<p>Dr Doyle coordinates global education and training for Bioconductor and is also the ELIXIR-Ireland training coordinator, commented on the importance of the event for coordination of training resources <em>“It was important for Bioconductor to be present at such an event as it allows us to connect with a wide range of stakeholders, gain insights from diverse perspectives, and foster relationships that could lead to impactful collaborations. These interactions contribute to Bioconductor growth and help us to improve our training offerings, making them more comprehensive, user-friendly, and effective”</em>.</p>
<p>Ireland’s most cited scientist, Professor Desmond Higgins, Emeritus Professor of Bioinformatics from the University College Dublin was honoured as the keynote speaker at the ninth ELIXIR All Hands international event. Higgins is one of the most cited life scientists in the world for his work on the Clustal suite of bioinformatics software programmes. He spoke about the history of Clustal and the impact that this package has had on bioinformatics research in his keynote speech. <em>“It was a fantastic honour to be invited. I have worked on bioinformatics methods since the mid 1980s. I have given talks in many countries over 40 years but this was one of the few opportunities have had to do this in Dublin, to an international audience.”</em> commented Professor Desmond Higgins.</p>
<p>Dr Elaine Harrison, ELIXIR’s Communication Officer commented on the success of the event.<em>“The event was a huge success, we were blessed with Dublin sunshine and enjoyed the excellent services of the Convention Centre. With over 90 speakers we ran 25 parallel workshops, 9 mini symposia, 3 plenaries and 2 lunchtime poster sessions.”</em></p>
<p>The event began and ended with remarks from Dr.&nbsp;Niklas Blomberg, ELIXIR’s director. He highlighted ELIXIR’s achievements over the 10 years and shared information on their plans for their 2024-2028 scientific programme. Dr Blomberg commented on how experts came <em>“from all over Europe and guests from as far afield as Australia and Canada”</em> to attend this event. Three hundred and eighty two people attended the event and one hundred and fourteen people attended the conference remotely. It was brilliant that Bioconductor was involved in such a collaborative and exciting meeting.</p>

<p>We’re delighted to share that Bioconductor was part of the <a href="https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/events/smorgasbord3/">Galaxy Smörgåsbord</a> global online training for the first time this year. Over the week of May 22-26, we extended the power of R and Bioconductor to a wider, global audience.</p>
<section id="tutorials-and-engagement" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tutorials-and-engagement">Tutorials and Engagement</h2>
<p>Our contribution to the Smorgasbord event centered on a series of comprehensive Bioconductor tutorials available on <a href="https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/modules/bioconductor">this page</a>. This presented an excellent opportunity for learners to explore Bioconductor’s robust capabilities in bioinformatics and computational biology. The tutorials were facilitated through the Galaxy platform, with all necessary packages pre-installed for a smooth, hassle-free learning experience. In a collaborative spirit, instructors (acknowledged below) volunteered to answer learners’ questions on their respective tutorials through the Galaxy Training Network Slack during the training week. A total of 13 Bioconductor tutorials were offered, resulting in 62 registered users, 128 workshop launches, and 27 R histories submitted for Smorgasbord certificate.</p>
</section>
<section id="competition" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="competition">Competition</h2>
<p>To further encourage active participation, we ran a friendly competition. Participants who completed a Bioconductor tutorial and submitted an R history before June 4th were eligible to win a free virtual registration to the Bioconductor conference <a href="https://bioc2023.bioconductor.org/">BioC2023</a>. We congratulate the winner, Paul Yu, a Master’s student from De La Salle University, Manila, Philippines!</p>
</section>
<section id="our-new-infrastructure" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="our-new-infrastructure">Our New Infrastructure</h2>
<p>The Smörgåsbord event also marked the public launch of the new Bioconductor Workshop platform, a successor to the <a href="https://github.com/seandavi/Orchestra">Orchestra platform</a>. The new platform (<a href="https://workshop.bioconductor.org/">workshop.bioconductor.org</a>) is a Kubernetes deployment of a Galaxy fork, notably leveraging the Kubernetes Interactive Tools runner to launch Bioconductor RStudio-based containers, each representing a workshop. This stack is running on a cluster of Jetstream2 nodes, supported by NSF ACCESS allocation BIR190004. This platform will be employed for the annual Bioconductor conference <a href="https://bioc2023.bioconductor.org/">BioC2023</a>, and the <a href="https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2023">ISMB/ECCB 2023</a> conference.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>By adopting Galaxy, Bioconductor hopes to broaden both the breadth of workshops available in the Galaxy Training Network, as well as the audience of Bioconductor workshops. A broader range of learning opportunities will empower scientists to excel in their research and tackle more complex questions with greater confidence and efficiency. We also hope to work with the usegalaxy.* administrators to make Bioconductor workshops available on all usegalaxy instances. We look forward to seeing more learners engage with Bioconductor tutorials, and we are excited about the potential for Bioconductor to contribute to more global learning initiatives like this.</p>

<figcaption>Bioconductor on Linux ARM64</figcaption>

</div>
<p><code>ARM64</code>, also known as <code>aarch64</code>, architecture is used in almost all mobile devices because of its lower electricity consumption compared to <code>x86_64</code>. In the last few years it is also being introduced more and more in server/cloud environments for the same reason.</p>
<p>Since June 8th 2023 the Bioconductor project has added a Linux ARM64 builder to the daily <a href="https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/3.18/bioc-LATEST/long-report.html">builds</a></p>
<section id="build-on-linux-arm64" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="build-on-linux-arm64">Build on Linux ARM64</h2>
<p>If you have access to a Linux ARM64 [virtual] machine (e.g.&nbsp;AWS Graviton, OracleCloud A1 Compute, etc.) then you can easily setup R 4.3.0 and start working on your Bioconductor package.</p>
<p>In this article I am going to explain the steps needed in case you work on x86_64 host machine by using the Bioconductor Docker Linux ARM64 image, i.e.&nbsp;using emulation.</p>
<section id="fetch-the-image" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fetch-the-image">Fetch the image:</h3>
<pre><code>$ docker pull --platform linux/arm64 ghcr.io/bioconductor/bioconductor:devel-r-latest</code></pre>
<p>Note the <code>--platform</code> argument! It tells the Docker client to pull the <code>arm64</code> flavor of the image. If omitted it will download the <code>amd64</code> flavor that matches the architecture of the host.</p>
</section>
<section id="run-the-image-unsuccessful" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="run-the-image-unsuccessful">Run the image (unsuccessful)</h3>
<p>If you try to run this image you will see an error about the wrong binary format:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/bioconductor/bioconductor:devel-r-latest bash
WARNING: The requested image’s platform (linux/arm64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/amd64/v4) and no specific platform was requested
exec /usr/bin/bash: exec format error</code></pre>
</section>
<section id="run-the-image-successful" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="run-the-image-successful">Run the image (successful)</h3>
<p>To make it possible to run arm64 Docker images on x86_64 host we will need to install QEMU (qemu-user-static):</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run --rm --privileged aptman/qus -s -- -p aarch64
cat ./qemu-binfmt-conf.sh | sh -s -- --path=/qus/bin -p aarch64 --suffix -static
Setting /qus/bin/qemu-aarch64-static as binfmt interpreter for aarch64</code></pre>
<p>Now it is possible to run the image:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/bioconductor/bioconductor:devel-r-latest bash
WARNING: The requested image’s platform (linux/arm64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/amd64/v4) and no specific platform was requested
root@b40c553def79:/# uname -a
Linux b40c553def79 6.2.0 #5 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Wed Mar 22 12:42:40 UTC 2023 aarch64 aarch64 aarch64 GNU/Linux</code></pre>
</section>
<section id="build-bioconductor-packages" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="build-bioconductor-packages">Build Bioconductor packages</h3>
<p>The Docker image comes with R pre-installed:</p>
<pre><code>root@b40c553def79:/# R --version
R version 4.3.0 (2023–04–21) — “Already Tomorrow”</code></pre>
<p>To build and test a Bioconductor package you will need to git clone it locally:</p>
<pre><code>root@b40c553def79:/# mkdir bioc &amp;&amp; cd bioc
root@b40c553def79:/# git clone https://git.bioconductor.org/packages/xyz
root@b40c553def79:/# R CMD build xyz
root@b40c553def79:/# R CMD check xyz_VERSION.tar.gz</code></pre>
<p>That’s it!</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="optimization" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="optimization">Optimization</h2>
<p>For easier and faster development it would be better to clone the package on your x86_64 host and mount the folder:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run -it --rm -v /path/to/package:/dev ghcr.io/bioconductor/bioconductor:devel-r-latest bash</code></pre>
<p>This way it will be easier to edit the source files with your preferred text editor on your workstation.</p>

  <title>Renaming the Default Branch to Devel</title>
  <dc:creator>J Wokaty</dc:creator>
  <link>https://bioconductor.github.io/biocblog/posts/2023-03-01-transition-to-devel/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>On March 8th, Bioconductor will rename the default branch on <code>git.bioconductor.org</code> to <code>devel</code>. This change has been many discussions and a lot of work in the making. Here’s why we’re doing it and how it impacts developers and maintainers. Users will not be impacted by this change.</p>
<section id="moving-toward-inclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="moving-toward-inclusion">Moving Toward Inclusion</h2>
<p>You might already be familiar with others, like the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2021/10/renaming-default-branch/">tidyverse</a>, moving away from the terminology “master” to use more inclusive language. We realize that this language is not representative of Bioconductor and it’s a step toward inclusion that’s inline with Bioconductor’s <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/about/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a> to provide a welcoming and supportive experience.</p>
<p>We specifically chose <code>devel</code> as it more aptly describes what this branch is within the context of Bioconductor.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="impact-on-bioconductor-package-developers-and-maintainers">Impact on Bioconductor Package Developers and Maintainers</h2>
<p>After March 8th, developers and maintainers will need to push their changes to the <code>devel</code> branch on <code>git.bioconductor.org</code>. If you have a repository on GitHub, we recommend renaming your default branch on GitHub first then renaming your branch in your local repository on your computer.</p>
<section id="rename-the-default-branch-on-github" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rename-the-default-branch-on-github">Rename the Default Branch on Github</h3>
<p>On GitHub, you can rename your <code>master</code> branch in your repository by going to <code>Settings &gt; Branches</code> then clicking on the pencil icon.</p>

<pre><code>git branch -m master devel
git fetch origin
git branch -u origin/devel devel
git remote set-head origin -a</code></pre>
<p>If you performed the prior steps to rename your default branch in GitHub, it will also provide you with the same code, which you can share with contributors.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>We are excited to welcome the Year 1 intake of instructor trainees for our <a href="https://bioconductor.github.io/biocblog/posts/2022-07-12-carpentries-membership/">Bioconductor Carpentries global training program</a>! 🎉</p>
<p>Eighteen applicants have been selected for Year 1, they are shown below, in the interactive map and listed alphabetically in the table.</p>
<section id="selection-of-applicants" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="selection-of-applicants">Selection of applicants</h2>
<p>We have been thrilled to receive many excellent applicants. We initially had mainly applicants from Europe, however, because we aim to provide a global distribution of instructors to support the global community, we’ve been working to increase applicants from other areas such as Africa, Asia and Latin America. Other aspects we have been taking into account for selection are, previous R/Bioconductor experience, organising experience, languages they can teach in, and how they intend to contribute to Bioconductor teaching. For Year 2, we aim to select some applicants in Latin America, as we currently have none there, aswell as applicants from other areas. We will be selecting for Year 2 in July and you can still <a href="https://forms.gle/SGaVkDZqCNKNSnHKA">apply in this form</a> if you’re interested.</p>
</section>
<section id="training-of-selected-applicants" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="training-of-selected-applicants">Training of selected applicants</h2>
<p>The Year 1 applicants are onboarding now and are at different stages of the process. The first step is attendance at an online <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/training_calendar/index.html">Carpentries instructor training workshop</a>, followed by completing <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/index.html">3 checkout tasks</a> (teaching demo, discussion, lesson contribution) within 3 months after the workshop. So far 3/18 trainees have completed the Carpentries certification - Fabricio Almeida-Silva, Leo Lahti and Charlotte Hutchings 👏👏👏. Once certified, the instructors will teach/co-teach one of the <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/help/education-training/">Bioconductor Carpentries Modules</a> within one year of certification. We connect with the trainees at the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s2QMk5XA-uhBVprAO3ZDk1Yfv1cnUWLp9zdvYq9Feu4/">monthly teaching meetings</a> and in the <a href="https://slack.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor Slack group</a>. We are looking forward to working with all of the new instructors and supporting them to provide Bioconductor training to the global Bioconductor community.</p>
<p>We are grateful to the <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/bioconductor-high-quality-training-and-support-for-a-worldwide-community/">Chan Zuckerberg Initiative’s EOSS program</a> for funding this initiative.</p>
<p>Update May 2023: Due to changes in availability, Mercilena Benjamin has been replaced by Roberto Alvarez-Martinez. This change was made prior to Mercilena’s commencement of the instructor training program.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><em>This blog post was co-written by the Bioconductor Community Manager, Maria Doyle, and the lead developer of CuratedAtlasQueryR, Stefano Mangiola.</em></p>
<p>We are excited to announce the launch of the <a href="https://stemangiola.github.io/CuratedAtlasQueryR/">CuratedAtlasQueryR</a> package! Millions of cells are now at your fingertips as the harmonized and reannotated CELLxGENE single-cell human atlas can be explored and retrieved in Bioconductor <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/SingleCellExperiment">SingleCellExperiment</a> data structure.</p>
<p><img src="https://bioconductor.github.io/biocblog/posts/2023-02-23-CuratedAtlasQueryR/overview.png" class="img-fluid" alt="A diagram showing the tools underlying the CuratedAtlasQueryR package and the workflow."></p>
<section id="why-this-package-was-created" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-this-package-was-created">Why this package was created</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.humancellatlas.org/">Human Cell Atlas</a> is a large-scale single-cell sequencing initiative that aims to map every cell type in the human body. It has the potential to revolutionise our understanding of human cellular biology and the immune system. Data harmonisation, curation and effective data query are essential to extract knowledge from these complex atlases. The <a href="https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/">CELLxGENE human cell atlas</a> provides an explorable and searchable human atlas. However, <a href="https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/">CELLxGENE</a> is not harmonised across datasets.</p>
<p>To allow exploration and analyses across datasets, tissues and diseases through R, we have developed <a href="https://stemangiola.github.io/CuratedAtlasQueryR/">CuratedAtlasQueryR</a>, a cell-resolved query system that allows researchers to select cells based on their type, tissue of origin, and demographics. This package will be submitted to <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a>. We have also created a Python version of CuratedAtlasQueryR that will be launched soon.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-it-differs-from-existing-packages" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-it-differs-from-existing-packages">How it differs from existing packages</h2>
<p>We use the existing Bioconductor package, <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/cellxgenedp">cellxgenedp</a> as the download source for datasets included in <a href="https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/">CELLxGENE</a>.</p>
<p>We then harmonised, curated and reannotated the data (immune cell labels).</p>
<ul>
<li>The column classes so they can be represented as a unique table.</li>
<li>We subset the columns that were most common across the atlas (the complete columns for a specific dataset can be retrieved through the <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/cellxgenedp">cellxgenedp</a> package).</li>
<li>We consolidated sample identifiers.</li>
<li>We harmonised tissue labels.</li>
<li>We harmonised cell-type labels under a common ontology.</li>
<li>We provide a consensus-based immune cell label, and a confidence label. Consensus was established among the original annotation and three independent references (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE107011">Monaco</a>, <a href="https://rdrr.io/github/LTLA/celldex/man/BlueprintEncodeData.html">BLUEPRINT</a>, and <a href="https://azimuth.hubmapconsortium.org/references/human_pbmc/">Azimuth PBMC</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>We introduced custom columns, not present in the original CELLxGENE metadata.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tissue_harmonised</code>: a coarser tissue name for better filtering</li>
<li><code>age_days</code>: the number of days corresponding to the age</li>
<li><code>cell_type_harmonised</code>: the consensus call identity (for immune cells) using the original and three novel annotations using Seurat Azimuth and SingleR</li>
<li><code>confidence_class</code>: an ordinal class of how confident <code>cell_type_harmonised</code> is. 1 is complete consensus, 2 is three out of four and so on.</li>
<li><code>cell_annotation_azimuth_l2</code>: Azimuth cell annotation</li>
<li><code>cell_annotation_blueprint_singler</code>: SingleR cell annotation using Blueprint reference</li>
<li><code>cell_annotation_blueprint_monaco</code>: SingleR cell annotation using Monaco reference</li>
<li><code>sample_id_db</code>: Sample subdivision for internal use</li>
<li><code>file_id_db</code>: File subdivision for internal use</li>
<li><code>.sample</code>: Sample ID</li>
<li><code>.sample_name</code>: How samples were defined</li>
</ul>
<p>Differently from <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/cellxgenedp">cellxgenedp</a>, we can query specific cells across datasets based on annotation, the metadata exploration and data download is done on-disk without loading into memory.</p>
<p>The harmonized and reannotated <a href="https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/">CELLxGENE</a> single cell human atlas can be explored and retrieved in Bioconductor <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/SingleCellExperiment">SingleCellExperiment</a> format.</p>
<p>We use <a href="https://duckdb.org/">DuckDB</a> in the package due to it’s speed, and low disk imprint in handling large amounts of data.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Get started with <a href="https://github.com/stemangiola/CuratedAtlasQueryR">CuratedAtlasQueryR</a> by exploring the integrated metadata of 28 million cells (on-disk) using <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a>. The atlas includes 344 studies across 40 tissues, providing raw abundances and counts-per-million. 📊</p>
